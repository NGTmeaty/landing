			<p class="question">Where is the data stored?</p>
			<p class="answer">
				Our data is currently stored in Amazon S3 in the United States. All
				content is legal under the US law. This means we may be forced to remove
				copyrighted or illegal material. Basically, content has to be inline with 
				the Amazon  Standards (which can be found <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/">here</a>).
			</p>

			<p class="question">How do I use this service?</p>
			<p class="answer">
				There are a ton of ways to hook into the API for OwO, if you're not very
				tech savvy (or just cant be bothered), theres a <a href="https://github.com/deansheather/owo.whats-th.is/wiki/Guide-for-ShareX">ShareX</a> and <a href="https://github.com/whats-this/owo.sh">MacOS/Linux</a> script, however if you want to write your own, or your script isnt supported please checkout the API <a href="https://github.com/whats-this/api">here</a>.
			</p>

			<p class="question">Private? I wanna upload!</p>
			<p class="answer">
				Currently, we're not accepting new users on the service, as we're
				constantly making improvements to our backend and distribution
				infrastructure and configuration. Shoot us an email and we'll get back
				to you at a later date.
			</p>

			<p class="question">What's the maximum filesize I can upload?</p>
			<p class="answer">
				Currently, the max filesize that you can upload to our server is 80MiB.
				This is to prevent large files taking up a lot of space, and costing a
				lot to store. In future this may be changed, but based on current demand
				its a solid point for filesizes.
			</p>

			<p class="question">What filetypes are allowed?</p>
			<p class="answer">
				All filetypes are viable to be uploaded now, however if you begin to upload
				dodgy things like viruses and your account constantly is under fire and
				throwing virus warnings your account <b>will be suspended</b>.
			</p>
